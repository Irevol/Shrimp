Notes:
- Don't mess with class `Enemy` unless you really have too, just make child classes
- Tiles are controlled from tile_set.tres, not the tile map layer node
- Upgrades must have scripts stored in reference in RewardMap
- Walkable tilemaplayer has opacity turned down in GameControl to make editing easier
